[Step 1: Start Page with Single 'Start' Button]
  - Framework: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
  - Logic: JavaScript (Button click event)
   |
   v
[Step 2: Collect Donut Images for Training Model]
  - Capture photos of different donut types (from different angles and lighting conditions)
   |
   v
[Step 3: Label and Annotate Donut Images]
  - Tool: LabelImg, RectLabel (for bounding box annotation)
   |
   v
[Step 4: Train AI Model (Image Classification or Object Detection)]
  - Option 1: Google Colab (with free GPU)
  - Option 2: Local Machine (if you have a powerful GPU)
  - Framework: TensorFlow/PyTorch (train with labeled donut images)
   |
   v
[Step 5: Convert Trained Model to TensorFlow.js Format]
  - Tool: TensorFlow.js Converter
   |
   v
[Step 6: User Presses Start - Camera Scanner Opens]
  - Tool: JavaScript, getUserMedia API (to access camera)
   |
   v
[Step 7: Capture Frame from Video Stream and Scan Donuts]
  - Tool: Canvas API (to capture video frames)
   |
   v
[Step 8: Run AI Model Locally to Count Donuts]
  - Library: TensorFlow.js (to detect and count donuts in real-time)
   |
   v
[Step 9: Display Results (List of Donut Types and Counts)]
  - Framework: Bootstrap (for mobile-responsive list display)
   |
   v
[Step 10: Add 'Scan Again' Button]
  - Tool: JavaScript (to reset scanner and start new scan)
   |
   v
[Step 11: User Presses 'Scan Again' - Reopen Camera Scanner]
  - Tool: getUserMedia API (reopen camera feed)
   |
   v
[Step 12: Repeat Scanning and Display Updated Results]
  - Logic: Capture frame -> Run AI model -> Display new count
   |
   v
